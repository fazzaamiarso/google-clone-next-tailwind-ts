# Google Clone

## Tools

- Next js + Typescript
- Tailwind CSS
- Google Custom Search Engine
- Google Search REST API

## Features

Implemented google search engine functionality with result pagination.

## Challenges

- First time using Tailwind CSS is a bit challenging to work and adapt with its syntax.
- Creating a third-party API Response's interface is tricky because the response could be unpredictable and the type may not be fully compatible.

## Solutions

- To adapt with Tailwind, I read the documentation a lot and watched tutorial from Tailwind Labs.
- To type the Response's interface, I did some research on how to do it and read the google API's documentation.

## What I learned

As a first timer on using Tailwind CSS, I found it pleasant and great to write css. My initial thought was it's going to be hard to understand or read its syntax. But, as time goes by I found out that it was only the initial thought. So, I learned how to be just do it and experience it myself rather than just thinking.
